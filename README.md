ðŸ“„ Indian Energy Sales Analysis â€“ Tableau Project 

This project focuses on analyzing Indiaâ€™s energy sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and performance insights across states and customer sectors. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders monitor and improve energy distribution efficiency.

Key Insights:

Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu recorded the highest sales due to strong industrial presence.

Seasonal analysis showed peak consumption during summer months, especially in urban regions.

Industrial and commercial sectors account for over 70% of total sales, while residential usage is steadily growing.

Forecasting models indicate an upward trend in energy demand in the next two quarters.

Tools & Techniques Used:

Tool: Tableau Public

Data Source: Indian energy sales dataset (state-wise, sector-wise monthly data)

Features: State-wise map visualization, KPI cards, trend analysis, customer segmentation, and sales forecasting

Outcome: Provided actionable insights for policy makers and energy companies to optimize production and distribution.
